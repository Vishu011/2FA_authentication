Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Using Speakeasy and Passport.js

Project Overview

This ongoing project is focused on building a secure and efficient two-factor authentication (2FA) system using Speakeasy and Passport.js. The goal is to enhance user authentication by implementing time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) as an additional layer of security. By integrating these tools, the project aims to provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution to safeguard application access.

Features

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adds an extra layer of security to user logins.

Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP): Utilizes Speakeasy to generate and validate secure codes.

Session Management: Integrates Passport.js for seamless authentication and session handling.

Enhanced Security: Protects against unauthorized access by requiring both credentials and a TOTP.

Technologies Used

Backend

Node.js: Server-side runtime for handling authentication workflows.

Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.

Passport.js: Middleware for user authentication and session management.

Speakeasy: Library for generating and validating TOTP codes.

Frontend (Planned)

React.js or another modern framework for building the user interface.

Project Workflow

User Registration:

Users sign up with their email and password.

A unique secret key is generated for each user using Speakeasy.

The secret is encoded into a QR code for easy scanning with an authenticator app.

Login Process:

Users log in with their credentials.

Upon successful login, they are prompted to enter a TOTP from their authenticator app.

The TOTP is validated using Speakeasy before granting access.

Session Management:

Passport.js manages user sessions to ensure seamless authentication across requests.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/2fa-authentication.git
cd 2fa-authentication

Install dependencies:

npm install

Create an .env file and configure the following:

PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

Start the application:

npm start

Future Enhancements

Frontend Integration: Build a modern, responsive UI for user interaction.

Backup Codes: Generate backup codes for 2FA recovery.

Email Notifications: Notify users of login attempts and account changes.

API Documentation: Add detailed documentation for REST APIs.
