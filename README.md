# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Using Speakeasy and Passport.js

## Project Overview
This ongoing project focuses on building a secure and efficient two-factor authentication (2FA) system using Speakeasy and Passport.js. The goal is to enhance user authentication by implementing time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) as an additional layer of security. By integrating these tools, the project aims to provide a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution to safeguard application access.

## Features
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adds an extra layer of security to user logins.
- **Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)**: Utilizes Speakeasy to generate and validate secure codes.
- **Session Management**: Integrates Passport.js for seamless authentication and session handling.
- **Enhanced Security**: Protects against unauthorized access by requiring both credentials and a TOTP.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for handling authentication workflows.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **Passport.js**: Middleware for user authentication and session management.
- **Speakeasy**: Library for generating and validating TOTP codes.

### Frontend (Planned)
- **React.js** or another modern framework for building the user interface.

## Project Workflow

### User Registration
- Users sign up with their email and password.
- A unique secret key is generated for each user using Speakeasy.
- The secret is encoded into a QR code for easy scanning with an authenticator app.

### Login Process
- Users log in with their credentials.
- Upon successful login, they are prompted to enter a TOTP from their authenticator app.
- The TOTP is validated using Speakeasy before granting access.

### Session Management
- Passport.js manages user sessions to ensure seamless authentication across requests.
